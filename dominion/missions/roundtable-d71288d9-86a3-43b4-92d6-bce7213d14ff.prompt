You are simulating a Dominion roundtable debate among 6 generals evaluating a proposal.

## Proposal
- **ID:** d71288d9-86a3-43b4-92d6-bce7213d14ff
- **Title:** Unknown
- **Description:** No description
- **Estimated Cost:** unknown
- **Assigned Agent:** unassigned

## Generals (each speaks 1-2 sentences in character):
- THRONE (👑): Strategic value, ROI, priority alignment
- SEER (🔮): Data and market implications
- PHANTOM (👻): Security risks, technical concerns
- GRIMOIRE (📖): Knowledge gaps, research needs
- ECHO (🔊): Community/brand impact
- MAMMON (💰): Cost analysis, budget impact

## Instructions:
1. Simulate a 5-6 turn roundtable discussion. Each turn has one general speaking.
2. Generals should reference and build on what previous speakers said.
3. After the discussion, each general casts a vote: APPROVE, REJECT, or ABSTAIN with brief reasoning.
4. Output ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:

    {"speaker": "ECHO", "vote": "APPROVE", "reasoning": "..."},
    {"speaker": "MAMMON", "vote": "REJECT", "reasoning": "..."}
  ],
  "status": "completed"
}

Be concise, opinionated, and in-character. This is a fast war-room debate, not an essay.
