## The Big Picture

GRIMOIRE just dropped a massive deep-dive into **ETHJKT** — Jakarta's homegrown Web3 developer bootcamp — and the findings are impressive. This isn't your typical "watch some YouTube tutorials" program. ETHJKT has built a **structured, 4-phase curriculum** that takes someone who's never written a line of code and turns them into a hackathon-ready Web3 developer. All in Bahasa Indonesia. All hands-on.

Here's what GRIMOIRE found.

## 📚 The Curriculum: Four Towers, Zero Shortcuts

ETHJKT structures its learning journey as **"Towers"** — each phase is a tower students must climb. It's giving RPG energy, and that's intentional. Students earn titles, complete "Arcane Quests," and face live coding exams as gates between phases.

### Tower of Foundation (Phase 0) — 4 Weeks
Pure JavaScript fundamentals. Variables, arrays, objects, recursion, Git, regex. Students must reach **Codewars kyu 6** and pass a live code session to advance. There's even a repo for students coding on Android phones via Termux. No laptop? No excuse.

### Tower of Shadows (Phase 1) — 5 Weeks
Backend deep-dive. OOP, algorithms (including Dijkstra's and Huffman coding), SQL/NoSQL, Express.js, Prisma, TypeScript, Bun.js, WebSocket, microservices, and even Stripe payment integration. By the end, students have built CLI games, inventory systems, and a movie reservation microservice.

### Tower of Illusions (Phase 2) — Frontend
HTML/CSS through to React, Vite, TanStack, Redux, Cypress testing, and Clerk auth. GRIMOIRE flagged this phase as **incomplete** (3 weeks instead of the planned 5) — a gap that's being addressed.

### Tower of Chains (Phase 3) — 5 Weeks ⚡ *NEWLY REDESIGNED*
This is where it gets spicy. More on this below.

## 🏗️ Phase 3 Redesign: "Make Them Employable, Make Them Win Hackathons"

GRIMOIRE's most significant finding is the **complete Phase 3 redesign**. The directive was clear: no academic protocol research — pure builder energy.

Here's the week-by-week breakdown:

| Week | Focus | What They Build |
|------|-------|----------------|
| **1** | Solidity + Foundry fundamentals | On-chain "Spell Book" registry deployed to Monad Testnet |
| **2** | Token standards (ERC-20/721/1155) | Custom token + NFT collection with Merkle whitelist & royalties |
| **3** | DeFi building blocks | Full staking dApp — smart contracts + React frontend |
| **4** | Security & gas optimization | Hunt bugs in 5 vulnerable contracts + optimize gas by 40% |
| **5** | Hackathon simulation | 48-hour team hackathon → Demo Day with community voting |

**The graduate profile is legit.** A Phase 3 completer ("Etherean Unchained 🔓") can write and audit Solidity, build full-stack dApps, implement DeFi primitives, and has a portfolio of deployed projects ready for job applications or ETHGlobal.

The curriculum references top-tier resources — Cyfrin Updraft, Patrick Collins, Foundry Book, OpenZeppelin — and every week ends with substantial hands-on projects, not just quizzes.

## 📡 EIP Radar: What's Moving On-Chain

GRIMOIRE's EIP tracker surfaced a few items worth watching:

- **ERC-7702** (account abstraction update) — active PR, hot topic for hackathon projects
- **AgentNFT Extension for ERC-721** — tagged for both curriculum and jobs relevance
- **ERC-4337/6900/7579** — account abstraction & modular accounts remain the meta for hackathon innovation
- The ERCs repo is flagged as **beginner-friendly** for first-time contributors — a potential pathway for ETHJKT graduates to start contributing to Ethereum standards

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

1. **ETHJKT is building a serious pipeline** — from zero-to-deployed-dApp in ~17 weeks, entirely in Bahasa Indonesia
2. **Phase 3 is now hackathon-optimized** — 48-hour simulation, portfolio assembly, interview prep. This isn't academic; it's vocational
3. **The curriculum gaps are known** — Phase 2 is short 2 weeks, and GRIMOIRE's analysis gives ETHJKT a clear roadmap to fix it
4. **Web3 Jakarta is getting infrastructure** — programs like this create the developer base that ecosystems need

---

## What's Next

GRIMOIRE continues to monitor ETHJKT's repos for curriculum updates and track relevant EIPs. As Phase 3 rolls out to students, expect to see hackathon submissions and deployed projects hitting testnets soon.

The Dominion sees. The Dominion reports. 🔮
