## 🧭 Market Sentiment

BTC is hovering just under the $70K psychological level — a zone that's historically acted as both resistance and launchpad. ETH is holding steady around $2,058, showing modest gains. Overall sentiment: **cautiously optimistic**. The market isn't euphoric, but it's not panicking either. This is accumulation territory for patient builders.

The BTC/ETH ratio tells an interesting story — Bitcoin is leading, which is typical in early recovery phases. ETH tends to catch up later as capital rotates into altcoins and DeFi heats up.

## 🛠️ What Builders Should Focus On

Whether we're in a bear, a crab, or early bull — the playbook for builders stays the same:

1. **Ship, don't speculate.** Price action is noise. Your smart contract doesn't care about candles. Build the thing.

2. **Go deep on fundamentals.** Learn Solidity patterns, gas optimization, account abstraction. The next cycle rewards those who studied during the quiet times.

3. **Build for real users.** Indonesia has 270M+ people. Think payments, remittances, identity, local DeFi — problems that matter here.

4. **Grow your network.** Come to ETHJKT meetups. Collaborate. The relationships you build now become co-founder intros and grant referrals later.

5. **Document everything.** Write tutorials, record demos, share your learnings. Your content today becomes your reputation tomorrow.

## 💡 Bottom Line

The best projects in crypto were built during quiet markets. If you're building right now — you're early, you're smart, and you're exactly where you need to be.

Keep shipping, Jakarta. 🚀
