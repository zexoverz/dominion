## Executive Summary

### Core Strategy
**Bitcoin Maximalist. No exceptions.**

All income streams convert to Bitcoin. No altcoins. No speculation. Institutional adoption (Harvard, BlackRock, US Strategic Reserve) provides floor. Bear markets are buying opportunities.

### Key Numbers (December 2025)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current Net Worth | Rp 369M liquid + Rp 350M house equity |
| Monthly Income | Rp 165M ($10,050) |
| Monthly Investment | Rp 112M (68% savings rate) |
| Current BTC | 0.07 BTC ($6,979) |
| 2030 Target | Rp 26B - 192B (depending on BTC price) |

### The Thesis
> "99% of altcoins die in bear markets. But Bitcoin? Institutions can't let it fail. Harvard, BlackRock, US Government — all holding. I'm front-running the biggest wealth transfer in history."

## Part V: Bitcoin Strategy

### All Roads Lead to Bitcoin
| Source | Action |
|--------|--------|
| OKU Salary | → BTC |
| ForuAI Cash | → BTC |
| ForuAI Tokens | Sell immediately → BTC |
| Pokemon Cards | Sell in bear → BTC |
| House Equity | Over-kredit to Dzikri → BTC |
| Bonuses | 50% BTC, 50% Wedding |
| Monthly Surplus | → BTC |

### Price Projections (Cycle-Aware)
| Period | BTC Price | Strategy |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Dec 2025 - Mar 2026 | $85K-95K | Normal DCA |
| Apr 2026 - Dec 2026 | $50K-70K | **MAX ACCUMULATION** |
| Jan 2027 - Dec 2027 | $40K-60K | **BEAR BOTTOM** |
| Jan 2028 - Apr 2028 | $50K-70K | Pre-halving DCA |
| May 2028 - Dec 2028 | $70K-100K | Post-halving |
| 2029 | $150K-300K | Bull run |
| 2030 | $250K-500K | Cycle peak |

### War Chest Deployment
| BTC Drawdown | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| -30% from ATH (~$88K) | Deploy 25% war chest |
| -40% from ATH (~$75K) | Deploy 50% war chest |
| -50% from ATH (~$63K) | Deploy 100% war chest |

### BTC Stack Projections (2030)
| Scenario | BTC Stack | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Worst (FORU = $0) | ~4.1 BTC | Salary DCA only |
| Personal FORU only | ~5.3 BTC | + Personal tokens |

## Part VI: House Strategy

### Current Loan Status
| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Purchase (Aug 2022) | Rp 793M |
| Current Value | ~Rp 1B+ |
| Remaining Principal | ~Rp 650M |
| Monthly Payment | Rp 6.3M |
| Fixed Rate | 4.75% until Aug 2027 |
| Floating Rate (after) | ~12.25% → ~Rp 8.6M/month |

### The Over-Kredit Play
1. Sell to Dzikri @ Rp 250-300M (equity)
2. Dzikri takes over Rp 650M loan
3. Deploy Rp 250-300M → BTC at bear prices
4. Rent cheap (Rp 3-5M/month) until 2029
5. Buy DREAM house CASH in 2029 (property crash + BTC bull)

### Math Comparison
| Option | 2030 Value |
|--------|------------|
| Keep house | ~Rp 1.3B (1.3x) |
| Sell → BTC | 0.3 BTC × $300K = Rp 1.5B (5x) |

---

## Part VII: 2030 Net Worth Projections (Corrected)

### The Correct Math
**$1 USD = Rp 16,400** (not Rp 164,000!)

| BTC Price | Per BTC in IDR |
|-----------|----------------|
| $150K | Rp 2.46B |
| $300K | Rp 4.92B |
| $500K | Rp 8.2B |
| $1M | Rp 16.4B |

### Scenario Matrix
| BTC Price | 4.1 BTC (Worst) | 5.3 BTC (Personal) | 11.7 BTC (Full) |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------| 
| $150K | Rp 10.1B | Rp 13B | Rp 28.8B |
| $300K | Rp 20.2B | Rp 26.1B | Rp 57.6B |
| $500K | Rp 33.6B | Rp 43.5B | Rp 95.9B |
| $1M | Rp 67.2B | Rp 86.9B | Rp 191.9B |

### What It Means (Monthly Passive at 5% Yield)
| Net Worth | Monthly Passive | vs Avg Indonesian |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Rp 13B | Rp 54M/month | 11x |
| Rp 26B | Rp 108M/month | 22x |
| Rp 58B | Rp 242M/month | 48x |
| Rp 96B | Rp 400M/month | 80x |
| Rp 192B | Rp 800M/month | 160x |

**Even worst case (Rp 10B) = Financial freedom achieved.**

## Part VIII: The 2030 Fire Sale Theory

### The Thesis
> "AI will destroy the Indonesian middle class by 2030. Mass unemployment + inflation + IDR depreciation = desperate selling. While everyone sells, I will be the buyer."

### Expert Predictions
| Source | Prediction |
|--------|------------|
| Dario Amodei (Anthropic) | 50% entry-level white-collar jobs gone in 5 years |
| Geoffrey Hinton (AI Godfather) | AI unemployment coming, new jobs won't replace |
| Goldman Sachs | 6-7% workforce displaced, young tech workers first |
| Senator Bernie Sanders | College grad unemployment could hit 25% |

### The Perfect Storm
| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| AI replaces jobs | Mass unemployment |
| No new jobs created | Permanent displacement |
| Inflation continues | 6-15% real inflation |
| IDR depreciates | -5% yearly vs USD |
| No safety net | Government can't help |
| Debt burden | Forced selling |
| **Result** | **Fire sale on assets** |

### My 2030 Shopping List
| Asset | Normal Price | Fire Sale Price | Use |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|-----|
| Dream house | Rp 3B | Rp 1.5-2B | Primary residence |
| Rental houses | Rp 2B each | Rp 1B each | Passive income |
| Land | Rp 2B | Rp 1B | Long-term hold |
| Car | Rp 1B | Rp 500M | Daily use |

### Why I'll Be Buyer, Not Seller
| My Advantage | Their Disadvantage |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Niche skills (Blockchain) | Generic skills (AI replaced) |
| 2 income streams | 1 income (fired = over) |
| Dzikri handles work | Time freedom to adapt |
| Hard assets (BTC) | Cash (depreciating) |
| No debt | Debt (forced to sell) |
| Young (24) | Middle-aged (hard to reskill) |

## Part IX: 2029 Life Upgrade Plan
