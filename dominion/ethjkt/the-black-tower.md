## What Is This?

The Black Tower is ETHJKT's inner circle — a closed group of our strongest builders. No spectators. No lurkers. Every member here has proven themselves through Phase 0-2 and earned their rank.

This is where we stop learning and start **contributing to Ethereum itself.**

---

## 🎯 Why The Black Tower Exists

Let's be real — Indonesia has **zero** protocol-level engineers. Plenty of dApp builders, plenty of Solidity devs, but nobody working at the foundation layer. No one reviewing EIPs. No one contributing to go-ethereum or reth. No one in the All Core Devs call.

**The Black Tower changes that.**

This is your path from dApp builder → protocol engineer. That's a career jump most Indonesian devs don't even know exists. Here's what you gain:

### 🌍 Global Presence

Your GitHub contributions to Ethereum core repos are visible to the entire world. Foundation teams, L2 teams, research labs — they all scout from the same contributor graph. One meaningful EIP comment puts you on the radar of people who will never find you on LinkedIn.

### 📜 EIP Contributor Status

Contributing to an EIP — even reviewing, testing, or commenting — puts your name in Ethereum's permanent history. This isn't a certificate from a bootcamp. This is your name on the protocol that runs $400B+ in value.

### 🛠️ Open Source Portfolio

Forget todo apps and weather dashboards. Your portfolio becomes merged PRs on OpenZeppelin, Foundry, ethereum/tests, execution-specs. Recruiters at Ethereum Foundation, Paradigm, Flashbots — they check GitHub, not resumes.

### 💰 Career That Doesn't Exist in Indonesia (Yet)

Protocol engineers at foundations and L2 teams earn $150K-$400K/year remote. There's almost no competition from Southeast Asia. You'd literally be the first wave.

### 🤝 Network That Compounds

The Black Tower connects you with people building at the same level. Your hackathon teammates, your PR co-authors, your research partners — these relationships compound over years.

> *Indonesia has 280 million people and zero Ethereum core contributors. We're fixing that.*

## ⚡ The Finality Room

**Weekly Call — 60 minutes**

Every week, the Black Tower convenes **The Finality Room** — ETHJKT's Ethereum research session where our top wizards dissect ERCs, debate protocol upgrades, and plan open-source contributions.

### Format

🔮 **The Oracle's Report** (15-20 min)
One randomly selected wizard presents something from Ethereum's frontier — a new ERC draft, an EIP heading to review, a protocol upgrade, a postmortem, a gas optimization discovery. Anything that pushes our understanding forward. Keep it raw, no slides needed.

⚔️ **The Round Table** (20 min)
Open floor. What are you building? What did you ship this week? What's happening in core dev? What did you read? This is where knowledge compounds.

🗺️ **The War Plan** (15 min)
Coordinate the week ahead — who's teaming up for a hackathon, who's targeting which PR, who needs review on what. Every week must produce artifacts.

### 🎲 Oracle Selection

At the end of each session, we randomly pick next week's Oracle. You have 7 days to find something worth sharing. The Tower holds you accountable.

---

## ⚔️ Async Quests

Between Finality Room sessions, the Black Tower operates async:

### 🏆 Hackathon Squads

When ETHGlobal, Devfolio, or any major hackathon drops — we form teams from the Black Tower and ship under the ETHJKT banner. GrimSwap was built this way. The next one will be too.

### 📜 EIP & OSS Contributions

Review each other's PRs. Pair up on Ethereum core contributions. Comment on EIP drafts. Fix OpenZeppelin docs. Every merged PR is ETHJKT's name on Ethereum's permanent record.

### 🔍 Audit Jams

Pick a live protocol. Read the contracts. Find the bugs. Write it up. Even if we don't find anything, the process sharpens everyone.

## 📖 The Mentorship Forge

The Black Tower doesn't just build for Ethereum — it builds **the next generation of ETHJKT wizards.**

Archmages and High Wizards are expected to review Pull Requests from Phase 0-3 students. Read their code, leave real feedback, push them to be better. You went through the same journey — now you guide others through it.

**How it works:**

- PRs from students land in each Phase repo
- Black Tower members pick PRs to review when they have time
- Leave meaningful reviews — not just "LGTM" but actual feedback on code quality, patterns, edge cases
- Tag yourself as reviewer so we track who's contributing

**🔑 This is how you rank up.**
Archmages who want to earn **High Wizard** — your PR reviews count as contribution. Consistent, quality mentorship is one of the clearest paths to promotion. The Tower tracks who shows up for the next generation.

> *A true wizard doesn't hoard knowledge. They multiply it.*

## 🔮 The Secret Chamber

**Course Creation**

High Wizards and Archmages don't just take courses — they **create them.**

The Secret Chamber is where the Black Tower writes ETHJKT's next generation of curriculum. Phase 3 (Smart Contracts), Phase 4 (Protocol Engineering), specialized workshops, advanced guides — all of it comes from here.

**How it works:**

- Black Tower members propose and write course material for ETHJKT
- Study materials, Arcane Quests, quizzes — the same format students know and love
- Your name goes on it as the author — permanent credit in the repo
- Course content gets reviewed by other Black Tower members before going live

**Why this matters:**

- Teaching is the highest form of mastery. If you can write a course on it, you truly understand it.
- You're literally building Indonesia's first protocol engineering curriculum. That didn't exist before you wrote it.
- Your courses train hundreds of devs. That's leverage no individual project can match.

> *The wizards who write the spellbooks shape the entire generation that follows.*

## ⚖️ The Code

1. **Ship or be silent.** This isn't a chat room. It's a war room.
2. **Teach what you learn.** Every Oracle session, every review, every research thread — you're building ETHJKT's collective intelligence.
3. **Represent.** When you contribute to Ethereum, you carry ETHJKT's name. Make it count.
4. **Show up.** Miss 3 Finality Room sessions without reason, you're back to the lower floors.
5. **Pull up the next generation.** Review student PRs. Write courses in the Secret Chamber. The Tower is only as strong as the wizards climbing toward it.
