# 2026-02-17 — ETHJKT Day

## Major Work
- **Phase 0 Revamp**: Sub-agent rewrote Week 2 (165→1389 lines), Week 3 (83→1269 lines), Week 4 (248→976 lines). All READMEs restructured with Arcane Quest branding. Pushed to all Ethereum-Jakarta repos.
- **Phase 0 Code Testing**: Tested 139 JS code blocks across all study materials — 0 failures. Fixed 7 context-dependent snippets (missing variable defs).
- **Phase 2 README Fixes**: Week 3 was missing 12 of 16 study materials in README. Week 4 had 8 broken filenames. Fixed and pushed to ETHJKT org repos.
- **ETHJKT Course Repo**: Added The Black Tower section to main ethjkt-course README (Indonesian)
- **Security**: Removed hardcoded PostgreSQL credentials from `database/apply.js` — was exposed in public dominion repo. Recommended Faisal rotate the DB password.

## ETHJKT Strategy
- **The Black Tower**: Full endgame doc created — inner circle for Archmages/High Wizards
  - The Finality Room: weekly Ethereum research call
  - Oracle system: random wizard presents ERC/EIP each week
  - Async quests: hackathon squads, EIP contributions, audit jams
  - The Mentorship Forge: PR reviews for Phase 0-3 students (counts for rank up)
  - The Secret Chamber: Black Tower members create courses
- **Discord channel posts**: Created About, Black Tower channel descriptions
- **Naming**: "The Finality Room" chosen for weekly research call, "The Scriptorium" / "The Spellforge" suggested for coding channel
- **First Finality Room**: Targeting early April — Faisal needs to learn protocol engineering first

## Faisal's Protocol Bootcamp
- Created 6-week prep plan at `dominion/reports/black-tower-prep-plan.md`
- 14-day bootcamp (Feb 17 — Mar 2): EVM opcodes → go-ethereum source → consensus → EIPs
- Phase 2 (Mar 3-16): First OSS contributions (OZ #6305, EIP comments, execution-specs)
- Phase 3 (Late Mar): Launch Finality Room, Faisal as Oracle #1
- **Daily cron nudge** set for 08:30 WIB to keep him accountable

## Dominion
- API healthy all day, $0 costs
- No proposals or missions needing attention
