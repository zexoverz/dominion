# 2026-02-18 — Wednesday

## Cron Fix
- All 5 cron jobs were failing since Feb 16 due to `model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4"` (unknown model)
- Tried `"sonnet"` alias → also failed (`anthropic/sonnet` unknown)
- Tried `null` to clear → patch merges, doesn't remove field
- **Fix:** deleted all 5 jobs and recreated without model field (uses default Opus)
- SEER BTC Daily test run succeeded immediately after fix
- Lesson: cron `model` field can't be cleared via patch — must delete+recreate

## Reports
- SEER BTC Daily Feb 18 generated: BTC $67,128-$67,812, F&G 8/100 Extreme Fear, -46.2% to -46.8% drawdown
- Daily Briefing ran but couldn't send to Telegram (missing chat ID in isolated session)
- Added Faisal's Telegram chat ID (1449994544) to TOOLS.md for future cron deliveries
