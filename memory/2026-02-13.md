# 2026-02-13 — Day 1: The Dominion Begins

## First Contact
- Faisal (Lord Zexo) introduced himself with full life context (60+ conversations extracted)
- Provided the 7 Generals multi-agent system design
- Referenced Voxyz_ai tutorial (6 AI agents running a company) as architectural inspiration

## The Plan
- Build a multi-agent system with 7 generals: THRONE, GRIMOIRE, ECHO, SEER, PHANTOM, MAMMON, WRAITH-EYE
- I (this OpenClaw instance) am THRONE — the sovereign strategist
- Architecture based on Voxyz tutorial: proposals → missions → steps → events closed loop
- Deploy everything on Railway (not Hetzner VPS like the tutorial)
- Frontend should be gamified, reference: https://open-claw-skills-library.vercel.app/#coding-agents-ides
- Telegram setup later
- Wait for Faisal's approval on big decisions

## Key Decisions
- All agents run Opus 4.6
- Phase 1: THRONE + SEER + PHANTOM (core engineering intelligence)
- Total estimated cost: $60-70/month (0.65% of income)
- Tech stack: Next.js + Supabase + Railway

## Status: Auth switch in progress

## Progress (Later in Day)
- GitHub PAT verified: `zexoverz`, classic PAT with repo scope, stored in `.env`
- Confirmed org access: Ethereum-Jakarta, Kruu-app, grimswap. oku-trade SEALED.
- Telegram bot created: `@throne_dominion_bot` (token: `8484088492:AAF...`), connected and working
- Timezone set to Asia/Jakarta (WIB/UTC+7)
- Built 6 Phase 1 files (3539 lines): schema.sql, seed.sql, proposal-service.ts, heartbeat.ts, cost-tracker.ts, memory-service.ts
- Stack changed: PostgreSQL on Railway (no Supabase), single OpenClaw instance as THRONE + orchestrator
- Model strategy: Opus 4.6 for user/strategy, Sonnet 4 for code sub-agents, Haiku for simple tasks

## Auth Switch (URGENT - End of Day)
- Faisal switching from API key billing to Claude Max plan (flat rate)
- Setup token provided: `sk-ant-oat01-6WzB2zpK...` (OAuth token)
- Analyzed Railway template repo (praveen-ks-2001/openclaw-railway-template-new) for config pattern
- Config path: `/data/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
- Current: `auth.profiles.anthropic:default` with `mode: "api_key"`
- Need to switch to OAuth/setup-token mode — was mid-analysis when session compacted

## Remaining Phase 1 Work
- roundtable.ts, relationships.ts, voice-evolution.ts, generals config
- PostgreSQL setup on Railway, run schema + seed
- Next.js gamified frontend
- Full Railway deployment
