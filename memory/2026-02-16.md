# 2026-02-16 — Major Session

## EIP & Open Source Quest Planning
- Faisal wants to start Ethereum core protocol / open source contributions
- Researched live issues across ethereum/EIPs, go-ethereum, execution-specs, consensus-specs, OpenZeppelin, Foundry, Uniswap V4
- Found EIP-4361 (geth) is a ZOMBIE — holiman ignores all requests since 2021, don't touch
- **Amsterdam hard fork** is the hot thing — EIP-7708 (Vitalik's, ETH transfers emit logs), EIP-7928 (BALs), active development

## Three Missions Created
1. **EIP Quest** (eeb7675d) — 20 steps: magicians forum, ethereum/tests #1498, execution-specs tests, EPF, EIP authorship
2. **OSS Quest** (b54518db) — 7 steps: OZ #6305 (ReentrancyGuard comment), OZ #6289 (quickSort), Foundry #5429 (compiler path)
3. **Protocol Bootcamp** (fb75ec0f) — 14-day study plan with full instructions per step

## EIP-7708 Magicians Draft
- Drafted comment for ethereum-magicians.org forum on EIP-7708
- Angle: privacy implications (privacy pools weaker, AA wallet obscurity reduced, MEV signal increase)
- Open question opinions: no on fee logs, yes on withdrawal logs, SYSTEM_ADDRESS over 0xeee
- Edge case: revert behavior for system logs
- Saved at dominion/reports/eip-7708-magicians-draft.md
- Faisal should do bootcamp Day 1-5 BEFORE posting (so he can handle follow-ups)

## Key Revelation
- GrimSwap was coded entirely by Opus 4.6 — Faisal did ideation, orchestration, privacy design
- His actual gap: never touched protocol-level code, EVM internals, client implementations
- Study plan adjusted to be very beginner-friendly with exact files/commands

## Frontend Fixes
- Built mission detail page (/missions/[id]) with expandable steps
- Made QuestCard clickable (was static before)
- Fixed bugs: priority mapping (numeric→string), status labels for both API formats
- Added API endpoints: POST /missions/:id/steps, PATCH /missions/:mid/steps/:sid
- Fixed proposed_steps JSON parsing bug in mission creation
- Fixed kind CHECK constraint issue (DB only accepts specific values, not "action")
- All 14 bootcamp steps have detailed instructions in output_data.instructions

## Advice Given
- Don't mention OKU Trade in EIP comments (employee, not founder)
- GrimSwap + ETHJKT is the right framing
- "Designed and shipped" not "built" for AI-coded projects
- Start bootcamp before posting magicians comment
- Use Sonnet for sub-agents (Opus rate limits)

## Background Work (while Faisal out)
- Fixed dispatch-missions.sh: replaced `source` with safe grep+cut parsing (titles with parens broke bash)
- Cleaned stale trigger queue: marked 4 dupes + test-derived missions as done
- Strategic planner ran, correctly skipped (7 active missions = queue full)
- All memory files updated, git committed
- System nominal: API up, $0 costs, 0 pending proposals

### Zexo's Quest System (later session)
- Created 3 Dominion missions for Faisal's EIP/OSS journey:
  - EIP Quest (20 steps, priority 100) — eeb7675d
  - OSS Quest (7 steps, priority 90) — b54518db
  - Protocol Bootcamp (14 steps, priority 95) — fb75ec0f
- Built mission detail page: `dominion/frontend/app/missions/[id]/page.tsx`
- Made QuestCard clickable, added getMission API call
- Fixed API: proposed_steps JSON parsing, added POST/PATCH step endpoints
- Fixed DB CHECK constraint — valid kinds: research, execute_command, code_review, write_content, deploy, test, analyze, notify, monitor
- Updated bootcamp steps 1-3 with detailed instructions via PATCH output_data.instructions
- Steps 4-14 still need detailed instructions (IN PROGRESS)
- Deployed API + frontend to Railway
- Key reports created: eip-7708-magicians-draft.md, protocol-bootcamp-guide.md
- Strategy: complete bootcamp Days 1-5 before posting EIP-7708 magicians comment
- Use GrimSwap/ETHJKT identity (not OKU Trade) for EIP contributions
