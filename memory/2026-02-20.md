# 2026-02-20 — Frontend Revamp Saga (Failed)

## What Happened
- Faisal asked for frontend redesign with real pixel art assets
- Attempted 7 versions in one day:
  - V3: OpenGameArt sprites, NES.css → "still sucks"
  - V4: Dark glassmorphism + Three.js particles → "still sucks"
  - V5: Holographic sci-fi, radial menu → menu hard to use
  - V5.1: Fixed nav, added mission detail → still not good enough
  - V6: Pokemon FireRed theme, Press Start 2P font, GBA sprites → "still sucks"
  - V6.1: Added FRLG map assets from pret/pokefirered repo → still bad
  - V7: Real FRLG battle terrains, summary screen bg, type badges → "everything messed up"
  - V7.1: Clean gradient backgrounds → "making it worse"
- **Faisal asked to revert to Feb 19 state** → reverted to commit a78a253

## Key Lessons Learned
1. **NEVER nuke the entire frontend** — do incremental changes on existing UI
2. **Raw game tilesets ≠ assembled maps** — summary_screen-bg.png is tile data, not a screenshot
3. **Test with real API data** — field names matter (agent_id not assigned_to)
4. **Cloudflare blocks everything** — spriters-resource.com, bulbagarden, most asset sites
5. **pret/pokefirered repo** has real FRLG assets (154 downloaded) but they're raw tile data
6. **Sub-agents can build fast but can't verify visually** — need to screenshot-check before deploying
7. **Don't keep iterating when the user is frustrated** — should have stopped after V4 and asked for specific reference screenshots
8. **party-bg.png tiles HP labels everywhere** — it's a tileset not a background
9. **Dockerfile must COPY public/** — learned this early, kept it

## Assets Downloaded (still in public/assets/pokemon/)
- 154 FRLG assets from pret/pokefirered + PokeAPI
- GBA Pokemon sprites, type badges, terrain tiles, character overworld sprites
- Could be useful later if Faisal wants to revisit

## Current State
- Frontend reverted to Feb 19 (commit a78a253)
- Original throne room, mission detail with expandable steps, treasury page
- All working and deployed

## DB Cleanup Done Earlier
- Deleted 18 junk missions + 24 junk proposals
- Added DELETE endpoints to API with FK cascade handling
